# Hill Cipher Cryptography

Machine learning techniques have been developed to transform plain text into encrypted text using the hill cipher encryption method. This involves using mathematical operations to alter the characters in the input text, making it more secure and harder to understand for unauthorized individuals. The use of machine learning suggests that these algorithms have been trained to apply the hill cipher in an automated manner, potentially improving the efficiency and accuracy of the encryption process.
